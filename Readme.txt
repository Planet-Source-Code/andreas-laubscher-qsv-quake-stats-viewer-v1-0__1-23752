Hi guys, and thanks for downloading this piece of code. I originally wrote it
for our clan, to see what was up at lan parties. It worked rather well, so I
decided to share the wealth with Planet Source Code. It shows a rather
comprehensive handling of collections and classes and, even though it is 
quite big, it is more of a beginner/intermediate project than anything else.

I am already working on version two, so if you see any bugs, or have any 
questions and suggestions, then feel free to drop me a line at:
